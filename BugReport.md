Bug Report

Know Bugs: 
1. Sometimes the animation of the camera does not work properly causing the camera to go far away from the player.
2. For some reason, UI Pause menu elements (buttons, scrollview) don't works on Dungeon scene. [WORK IN PROGRESS]
3. Due to the rigidbody movements mobs are stupid and glitchy, sometimes they rotate on position even if the rigid body rotation are fixed.
