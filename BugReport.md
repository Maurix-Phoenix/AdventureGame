Bug Report

- [FIXED] For some reason, UI Pause menu elements (buttons, scrollview) don't works on Dungeon scene.

Known Bugs: 
- Sometimes the animation of the camera does not work properly causing the camera to go far away from the player.
- Due to the rigidbody movements mobs are stupid and glitchy, sometimes they rotate on position even if the rigid body rotation are fixed.
